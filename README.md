#UG Major Project -- College Management

Step 1: Google authentication is implemented in this project so initial setup for that is a zip is saved in the VIEW Folder in the APPLICATION Folder Section. Just extract it and save it in the VIEW Folder itself

Step 2: Add SQL file in the DATABASE. its in the main folder named college_management.sql...Give this same name as the database name because we already set the database as that inside the project code.
